Phone Billing System by Jimmi Bacher
============

-  Compilation: 	1. Libraries: 
				+ stdio.h
				+ string.h
				+ stdbool.h
				+ math.h
			2. I have used Codeblocks as the IDE of my choice;
			    Coded, compiled and ran on it;
			     Four differenct csv-files.

- Execution: 	Use Codeblocks as IDE, run the code.

			The code is straightforward, meaning that the user has to only put in two inputs (rates-file and cdr-file)  and
			the magic unfolds. 
			
- Completed Tasks: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3 and Task 4 (half of Task 5)
				




Thanks! ;)
